# PPO

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is an on-policy model-free actor-critic RL method. It is arguably the most popular deep RL method currently available for continuous control.

For continuous state space environments, run:

```bash
uv run -m tinker.ppo.continuous
```

For discrete state space environments, run:

```bash
uv run -m tinker.ppo.discrete
```
